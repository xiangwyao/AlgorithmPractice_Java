# AlgorithmPractice_Java

This project repository will be a self learning media to help me consolidate my skills of Algorithm analysis and design. 

## Getting Started

Serveral topics will be included in this repository:
### 
### Dynamic Programming
### 
### Graph Theory

Unit testing will be added accordingly. 

```
Try to consider the boundary conditions as well as the general cases.
```
 


## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

### And coding style tests

To be added in the future.

## Acknowledgments

Several Algorithm design books have helped me learn the good coding Style.
* Hat tip to anyone who's code was used
* Inspiration
